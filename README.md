# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Songs To Learn
Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP1804/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: Saaipranav Subramanian

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
`songs.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
`songs_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used... it is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it again.

Edit this README file, replacing the instructions (including this paragraph) with your own assignment details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the `answer...` parts).  
Note: If you use the free WakaTime service on your own machine, you can track exactly how long you spent in code.

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?
> the entire project took around 22 hours which was longer than expected due to improper management of time and techincally difficulties causing me to restart the code from scratch multiple times.


2. What do you plan to do  differently in your development process for assignment 2?
> make a strict schedule and stick to it.
